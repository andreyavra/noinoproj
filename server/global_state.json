            "articleContent":"Apple recently launched the iPhone 11 in their Apple Event 2019, but they also made a lesser known announcement: a new product in the works - the iDialup. The iDialup is exactly what it sounds like- Apple is taking a go at making everyone’s favourite household relic. Bob Pear comments on the design process of the iDialup: “... we wanted to include a modern twist on the classic retro aesthetic of dial up modem....to achieve that we decided to take the original design and abstracted its features until we are left with nothing but the iDialup - a white rectangle with an LED screen.” \n Apple of removed all the bad design choices of the dial up, such as the clunky, bulky design, and kept the parts that mattered, such as the nostalgic starting sound and the slow connection speed. Consumers can now enjoy this technology as part of their everyday lives now. \n However this groundbreaking piece of tech will sent you back $1200. But it’s a small price to pay for the joys of early 2000’s internet."
